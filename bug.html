```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient utility classes. However, if the `to-purple-500` class is not defined (e.g., due to a typo or a missing plugin) or if the color names are incorrect, this may result in unexpected rendering or no gradient at all.
