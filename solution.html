```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This corrected code ensures the color names (`blue-500` and `purple-500`) are accurate and that the necessary plugins (if any) for these colors are included in your `tailwind.config.js` file. If the issue persists, verify your Tailwind CSS configuration and installation.
